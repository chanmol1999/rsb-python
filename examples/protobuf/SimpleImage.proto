// This is the definition of the data that is exchanged between
// informer and listener in this example.
//
// To generate the data holder classes, which are used in the listener
// and informer programs, invoke the protocol buffer compiler as
// follows:
//
//   protoc --python_out=. SimpleImage.proto
//
// The result produced by the protocol buffer compiler will be a file
// called SimpleImage_pb2.py containing the data holder class
// SimpleImage.
//
// Note that this code generation step would usually happen
// automatically as part of the build process in a real project.
